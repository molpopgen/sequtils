.SH NAME
trimallgaps \- a program to remove gap characters from sequence files
in FASTA format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trimallgaps -i <infile> -o <outfile>
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtrimallgaps\fP will remove all gap characters (dashes, '-') from a file
of aligned sequences.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBtrimallgaps\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-i <infile>
specify the file containing a gapped alignment in FASTA format
.TP
.B \-o <outfile>
specify an outfile to which to write the output.  If no outfile is specified,
the results are written to stdout
.TP

change the behavior of the program to only remove gaps from the end of the
